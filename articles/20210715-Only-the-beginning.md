title: Only the beginning...

Well...I've finally done it. I've actually got around to building my first blog. Now the question lies "What to write about?". Well since we're only starting this journey, how about we start at the beginning? It only seems fitting.

### whoami

If you haven't guessed already, my name is Jeremy, and I've been working in InfoSec since 2015. I had always been into computers, started writing [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/) scripts when I was about 8 or 9 (who remembers?), ventured into a little bit of graphic design working with Photoshop 6? waaay before it was even the 'creative suite' we know today. Tried installing my first [linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) distro when I was about 12. At the time I had no idea what I was doing (still don't), but funnily enough after scouring the Internet, I ended up selecting [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) as my first distro, which can only be described by the urban dictionary definition of *"Watching shit scroll by for hours makes me a linux expert overnight!"*. Lemme just say that there should have been some kind of warning on the website that said...*"good luck compiling your kernel on a Pentium 4"*. At least that's what I think I was using at the time. Anyway, after about 3 days of compiling and frustration, I think I put that project on hold to resume gaming. Though looking back now, I wish I had kept going on with the project, as that kinda knowledge back then may have kickstarted my career in InfoSec a lot sooner. None the less, I found my way here today, working mostly on red team engagements, messing with a homelab and trying to automate everything.

### find / -name "jeremy" 2>/dev/null

These days I find myself residing in chilly New Zealand. After some personal woes back home in Australia. Unfortunately with COVID still around it's not easy to go visit home all too often, but it's nice to think that I'm just across the pond. Being able to work remotely has definitely been a plus, and I'm thankful that I can even do that...I guess that's one positive thing that has happened since COVID? Since being here, I got to check out the [Weta Workshop](https://www.wetaworkshop.com/), which is basically Disneyland for all you Lord of the Rings nerds like me, got to experience my first day of snow fall, and just lived internationally for the first time. It's been quite the adventure, but I'm looking forward to more.

### while: do things; done?

Since leaving Australia, I've had to leave my homelab behind. So naturally I find myself wishing I had one down here. Eventually I will get around to maybe just settling for an Intel NUC (I've got rackservers back home) and installing a type 1 hypervisor on it, like [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) or just plain [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/). With whatever free time I have these days, I've been quite productive. I've been diving deeper into linux internals, learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and writing small programs to continue developing and learning. It's been a bit difficult to select some projects, as I'm finding the limiting factor is that I no longer have a homelab to spin something up and do some testing, but alas I've kept it going by settling for kvm on my laptop and reading books on rust and linux.

### shutdown now

I guess that's all for now, I'll try to keep the blogs less personal and more technical hence forth, but I'm always keen to have a chat about other stuff, should you feel the need. Check out the contacts page for other methods of contact.
