## about

The names Jeremy, I've been working in InfoSec since 2015, working mostly in red teaming these days. I spend my free time automating all the things, and forever learning. If you want to learn a little bit more about me you can check out my first blog post [here](/articles/20210715-Only-the-beginning.md)


## notable projects

* Automated red team infrastructure - Terraform, AWS, Docker, Wireguard
  * Worked on this project in collaboration with another colleague. It automates all our tooling used for red teams. This includes all phishing infrastructure, including mail servers, dns, redirectors, command and control, and vpns. Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to share this one with you all.
* [bookmarkd](https://github.com/anomalyze/bookmarkd) - Rust, Docker
  * I built this little daemon because I was getting annoyed that I couldn't save bookmarks on one machine and not access them on another. It basically just sits on the network, and I can access it via a CLI tool which I also built. This was mainly just to find a project to work on to learn rust.
* [jereee.me](https://github.com/anomalyze/jereeeme) - Rust
  * Thie site is written in 90% rust, while the remaining is just a bit of HTML, CSS and lots of Markdown. This was another project I built, mostly just to learn Rust, but I thoroughly enjoyed trying to figure out how to create a template engine and minimise writing as much HTML, CSS as possible. There's probably a few bugs here and there, but it's only the first iteration.
